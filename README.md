BrainyBot (BB) is a robot infrastructure that can be programmed to solve turn-based, single player board games, such a Candy Crush Saga, Ball Sort Puzzle, 2048 and whatever else in your mind, on top a mobile touch device. 
Brainybot is both a physical robot that physically touches a phone screen or, in alternative, gestures can be simulated by sending events to a mobile device. 
The hardware version of BB is based on the great TapsterBot design from Jason Huggins (https://github.com/tapsterbot/tapsterbot, https://tapster.io/)
